mcabber-jingle is a set of modules implementing:
* Jingle (XEP-0166), a XMPP extension for managing peer-to-peer sessions
* Jingle File Transfert (XEP-0234), a Jingle application type for transferring
  files between two entities.
* Jingle In-Band Bytestreams (XEP-261), a Jingle transport method that sends data
  using the In-Band Bytestreams (IBB) protocol (XEP-0047).
  
====INSTALLATION====
To build the modules, you will need loudmouth and mcabber headers files along
with cmake. On Debian/Ubuntu, cmake is provided by the "cmake" package and the
loudmouth header files in "loudmouth-dev".
Once you have installed them, you can simply run "cmake .", then "make install"
as root. This should install the 3 modules in /usr/lib/mcabber.
To load them, type "/module load jingle", "/module load jingle-ft" and "module
load jingle-ibb". You can also load them automatically by putting those three
lines in your mcabberrc without the leading slash.
